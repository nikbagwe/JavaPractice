JAVA Notes:

Method ->
Business Logic (re-usability)
it can return value
----------------------------------------------------------

Constructor ->
Restricting of Object Creation
To initialize class variable with initial value
can not return any value
No void can be used.
name should be same as ClassName

----------------------------------------------------------

Static method-> calling by ClassName
Non Static -> call by object name
constructor -> when we create the object

----------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation

'this' keyword can be used in methods as well.
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data
into a single unit, typically a class. In Java, encapsulation is implemented by making class variables private
to restrict direct access and providing public getters and setters to access and modify these private variables.

This approach ensures that private data is accessed and modified only through a controlled public interface,
enforcing data hiding and better control over the behavior of the class.


-Encapsulation means accessing the private properties(variables) of class from another class using the getter and setter method

-Getter and setter are always public methods
-Instead of setter we can also initialize the private variable values using parameterized constructor but
to update the values of private variables we would need setter method anyways.


Inheritance:

isaRelation ---->  Inheritance.

Method Overriding -> Run Time Polymorphism
->When you have a method in parent class and same method in child class
1. With the same name
2. With the same number of parameter
3. With the same sequence of parameters
4. With the same return type

Example

Parent Class ->

public Class Car {

int wheels;
double price;

public void start()
{
System.out.println("Car Start");
}

Child class
public class BMW extends Car {

@Override // notation to show its overriden class , not compulsory bt good practice
public void start()

{
System.out.println("BMW Start");
}
--------------------------------------------

In Above example, car (parent class) And BMW(Child class) has same start() method. so its an override class
as it has
same name -> Start()
same number of parameters -> 0 paramters passed
same return type  -> void
same sequence of params -> Not Applicable here

so this is method overriding.
